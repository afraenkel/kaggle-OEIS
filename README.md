## Kaggle Competition to "predict integer sequences found on Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)."

In general, sequence prediction is a little silly, as any arbitrary
list of integers constitutes a sequence -- so much of this effort
reflects the contributions made to the OEIS. At best, this reflects an
effort into understanding the structure of sequences that
derive from human investigation. There is, however, noise coming from
the quirks of the OEIS site itself (e.g. typical length of sequences)
as well as biases associated to contributors to the site.

## Tasks

* Descriptive stats notebook

* NSTM RNN to predict next term
    - may want to segment based on "type of sequence"

* Would be awesome to link this to description on OEIS site for NLP
  and a sort of sentiment analysis on sequence types.
